              you is
              how to teach yourself. We often just end up drilling specific exercises and mindlessly memorizing
              information
              so that when exam time comes around, we pass the test. But once the test is over, that
              information has outlived its usefulness, and there's no guarantee that information will be
              retained. In the end, we're really just learning how to pass our tests.

              does this
              approach of repetition and memorization help us truly understand the subject material? The academic
              consensus
              nowadays is that it doesn't. In fact, what's more important than any individual topic is knowing how to
              study,
              but for some reason, this point is often overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy this?
