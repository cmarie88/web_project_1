            <div class="two-columns__paragraph">Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches
              you is how to teach yourself. We often just end up drilling specific exercises and mindlessly memorizing
              information so that when exam time comes around, we pass the test. But once the test is over, that
              information has outlived its usefulness, and there's no guarantee that information will be
              retained. In the end, we're really just learning how to pass our tests.

              does this approach of repetition and memorization help us truly understand the subject material? The
              academic consensus nowadays is that it doesn't. In fact, what's more important than any individual topic
              is
              knowing how to study, but for some reason, this point is often overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy
              this?
