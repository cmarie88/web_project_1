            <p class="two-columns__paragraph">Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches
              you is how to teach yourself. We often just end up drilling specific exercises and mindlessly memorizing
              information so that when exam time comes around, we pass the test. But once the test is over, that
              information has outlived its usefulness, and there's no guarantee that information will be

              does this approach of repetition and memorization help us truly understand the subject material? The
              academic consensus nowadays is that it doesn't. In fact, what's more important than any individual topic
              is
              knowing how to study, but for some reason, this point is often overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy
              this?

            <p class="two-columns__paragraph">Well, there are various techniques and exercises that can be applied to
              the educational process to help make it more efficient and engaging. Keep scrolling to uncover some of the

            <p class="two-columns__paragraph">Math didn't come naturally to Barbara in childhood. She thought of herself
              as more of a humanities person, and not a brilliant one at that. With an eye to becoming a linguist, after
              school she enlisted in the army, who sent her to learn Russian. After several years of service,
              during which she rose to the rank of Captain, Barbara left the army and decided to study
              engineering. In was during this time that she developed her learning methodology as she was
              forced to reprogram her brain for a different kind of learning. It turns out that when something
              doesn't come naturally to you, having to work hard to gain the knowledge that other people
              may get at first glance gives you a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
